            <h1>Who I am</h1>
            <p>My name is Sevag Sepetjian, and I'm a software developer from Los Angeles, CA. To keep it short and to the point, I'm just a long time nerd that started programming a little later than I would've liked. Ever since then I have been completely captivated by programming and the field of computer science, and have been relentlessly studying and practicing these subjects to make up for lost time. If you'd like to chat about anything you can reach me at sevsepetjian at pm dot me.</p>
            <h1>What this platform is about</h1>
            <p>Not too long ago I stumbled upon this idea of a <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden" target="__blank">Digital Garden</a> and projects like <a href="https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/" target="__blank">this</a> that were based on that idea. Inspired, I decided to build my own digital garden (source code <a href="https://github.com/sevsepetjian/knowledge-base" target="__blank">here</a>) where I can continually deposit and consolidate everything I learn. I will also be writing about all my interests and hobbies outside of tech, as they heavily influence and inspire my work. Furthermore, I think at times we forget that people aren't just their profession, and that you can connect with them outside of what they do for a living. Lastly, I hope that by building and continually contriubting to this, I can repay the kindness to all the strangers of the internet that took their time to write up such quality content. These type of individuals have been essential to my growth both personally and professionally. I hope that you find something here that is useful and interesting to you, or at the very least, this platform acts like a sign post that leads you to the place that you were looking for.</p>
