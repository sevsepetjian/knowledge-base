            <h1>What this platform is about</h1>
            <p>I have wanted to create a learning platform for quite some time. I've had maybe a half a dozen different variations of this, but none of them ended being what I had hoped. I think the main problem of my previous attemps was the design of the platform. I had thought that I can consolidate my learning with a blog-type design, but everytime I started writing it ended up being a overgeneralized story of that particulat topic. It lacked all those technical details that are part of the learning process, and it started to become more form over function. I was getting caught up with things that ultimately didn't matter, such as if the reader will find the post intelligent, or if the image was "cool" enough and if it related to that current topic. I was getting away from original reason as to why I even started the project, and that was to have a place where I can record my learning journey. I don't want to suggest that blog form of writing is the wrong design for everybody, it just so happened to be the wrong form for me. Utlimately use whatever works best for you.</p>
            <p>What I hope to have accomplished here is a wiki-type design. A place I can continually deposit and cnosolidate everything I learn, and be able to refrence it very quickly should I need to at any given point.</p>
            <h1>My learning goals</h1>
            <p>Here is what I would like to learn and all the different things I'm interested in.</p>
