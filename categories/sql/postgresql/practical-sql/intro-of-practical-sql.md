This [book](https://nostarch.com/practicalsql) was written by Anthony DeBarros. It teaches SQL in a very strucutred and principled way with clear and concise examples and problems for you to try. Also, it leverages PostgreSQL as the means to not only teach the fundamnetals of SQL, but all of the features uniquely to it (PostgreSQL).
