# Introduction
---

This book was written by Steven Skiena, and also used in his courses which can be found [here](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/videos/). I will be using both the course lectures and this book to study this topic. Furthermore, I will be supplementing practice problems with [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), as well as the problems found in the book.
